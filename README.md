# Tailwind CSS Concentric Circles Design

This repository contains a simple, yet elegant, example of a web page that utilizes Tailwind CSS to create a design with concentric circles. Each circle is styled with different background colors and shadows to produce a layered, bullseye-like visual effect. The design is responsive and centers itself on the viewport, showcasing the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS.

## Description

The main feature of this web page is its minimalistic design that focuses on the use of Tailwind CSS for styling. The page is made up of nested `div` elements, each representing a circle with a distinct size and color. The outermost circle has an emerald green background, the middle circle is teal, and the innermost circle is red, each casting a subtle shadow to enhance the depth.

The background of the page is a radial gradient from blue to a lighter shade, providing a soothing backdrop for the concentric circles. This project is a perfect starting point for developers looking to get hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS and to understand how its utility classes can be applied to create beautiful, responsive designs with minimal CSS.
